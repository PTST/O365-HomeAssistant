# Office 365 Integration for Home Assistant
This integration enables 
1. Getting calendar events from O365.
2. Sending emails via the notify.o365_email service.
3. Getting emails from your inbox. 

This project would not be possible without the wonderful [python-o365 project](https://github.com/O365/python-o365).

# Installation

## Getting the client id and client secret
To allow authentication you first need to register your application at Azure App Registrations.

Login at [Azure Portal (App Registrations)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade)

Create an app. Set a name.

In Supported account types choose "Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com)", if you are using a personal account.

Set the redirect uri (Web) to: `https://<your_home_assistant_url_or_local_ip>/api/o365` and click register.  


Write down the Application (client) ID. You will need this value.

Under "Certificates & secrets", generate a new client secret. Set the expiration preferably to never. Write down the value of the client secret created now. It will be hidden later on.

Under "Api Permissions" add the following delegated permission from the Microsoft Graph API collection
* offline_access - *Maintain access to data you have given it access to*
* Users.Read - *Sign in and read user profile*

If `calendar_access` is equal to `ReadWrite`
* Calendars.ReadWrite - *Read and write user calendars*
* Calendars.ReadWrite.Shared - *Read and write user and shared calendars*

If `calendar_access` is equal to `Read`
* Calendars.Read - *Read user calendars*
* Calendars.Read.Shared - *Read user and shared calendars*

If `email_access` is equal to `ReadWrite`
* Mail.ReadWrite - *Read and write access to user mail*
* Mail.ReadWrite.Shared - *Read and write user and shared mail*
* Mail.Send - *Send mail as a user*
* Mail.Send.Shared - *Send mail on behalf of others*

If `email_access` is equal to `Read`
* Mail.Read - *Read access to user mail*
* Mail.Read.Shared - *Read user and shared mail*

### example o365_calendar.yaml:
```yaml
- cal_id: xxxx
  entities:
  - device_id: work_calendar
    end_offset: 24
    name: My Work Calendar
    start_offset: 0
    track: true

- cal_id: xxxx
  entities:
  - device_id: birthdays

```

## Authentication.
### Default auth flow.
After setting up configuration.yaml and restarting home assistant a persisten notification will be created.
1. Click on this notification.
2. Click the "Link O365 account" link.
3. Login on the microsoft page.
4. Close the window when the message "Success! This window can be closed" appears.
5. That's it.

### Alt auth flow.
**NB. This requires the *alt_auth_flow* to be set to *True* and the redirect uri in your Azure app set to "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient" this needs to be set as as a manual url, with type web, just checking the checkmark for it does not seem to work**  
After setting up configuration.yaml with the key set to _True_ and restarting home assistant a persisten notification will be created.
1. Click on this notification.
2. Click the "Link O365 account" link.
3. Login on the microsoft page.
4. Copy the url from the browser url bar.
5. Insert into the "Returned Url" field. and click Submit.
5. That's it.

## Errors
* **The reply URL specified in the request does not match the reply URLs configured for the application.** 
  * Please ensure that you have configured base_url in your http config https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http/#base_url and that you have added the correct reply url to your Azure app
* **Client is public so neither 'client_assertion' nor 'client_secret' should be presented.**
  * Please ensure that you have set "Default client type" to Yes in your Azure app under Authentication ![Default client type img](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17211264/72337364-ba936a80-36c2-11ea-834d-2af9b84a8bba.png)
* **Application {x} is not configured as a multi-tenant application.**
  * In your azure app go to Manifest, find the key "signInAudience", change its value to "AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount"
* **Platform error sensor.office365calendar - No module named '{x}'**
  * This is a known home assistant issue, all that's needed to fix this should be another restart of your home assistant server. If this does not work, please try installing the component in this order:
  
  
    1\. Install the component.  
    2\. Restart home assistant.  
    3\. Then add the sensor to your configuration.yaml  
    4\. Restart home assistant again.  

**_Please note that any changes made to your Azure app settings takes a few minutes to propagate. Please wait around 5 minutes between changes to your settings and any auth attemps from Home Assistant_**
